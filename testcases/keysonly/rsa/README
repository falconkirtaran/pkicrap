RSA private key test cases

To generate a public key if one is needed, use
openssl rsa -in $i -pubout -out ${i}.pub

By default, values are plausible unless mentioned in the case.

Case descriptions:

0exp            All key information except the modulus is 0
0mod            The modulus is 0
0priv           The private exponent is 0
0pub            The public exponent is 0
1priv           The private exponent is 1
1pub            The public exponent is 1
2priv           The private exponent is 2
2pub            The public exponent is 2
4pub            The public exponent is 4
badcoeff        The coefficient parameter is corrupted
bade1           The exponent1 (dp) parameter is corrupted
bade2           The exponent2 (dq) parameter is corrupted
badp1           The prime1 (p) parameter is corrupted
badb2           The prime2 (q) parameter is corrupted
badpriv         The private exponent (d) is corrupted
e16385_m65536   e is 16385 bits all one, and m is 65536 bits; key is valid
legit1024       An undoctored 1024-bit RSA key, e=65537
p1mod           The modulus is corrupted by adding one
revexp          The two exponent parameters dp and dq are reversed
revpq           The two prime parameters are reversed
revprivexp      The private exponent is 65537, with a corresponding valid e
verFFFF         The version field is set to a reserved value 0xFFFF
verybig         A valid 32769 bit key with e is 32768 bits all one
